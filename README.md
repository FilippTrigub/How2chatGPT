How to learn coding an improve your coding experience!  <br><br>

The code in this repo was completely created by chatGPT with me only using copy and paste and changing text elements.
It's purpose is to examplify the automation process with chatGPT.  <br><br>

Use it to learn new languages, new skills or just to simplify your life as a developer. <br><br>

Install the requirements and run it via <br><br>
`uvicorn flowchart:app --host localhost --port 8000 --reload`

Or just follow the flowchart.
